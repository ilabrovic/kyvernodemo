# Test repo with Gitops

this repo can be used to test the Gitops Deployment
create a new repository in Gitops
The Kyverno policy already included the github's CA to Gitops

Upon saving the repository, the status icon should be green indication the rep is connected

Then create an application, and use 'dev01-gitops-app' as the folder

The application in Gitops should now be deploying the application to the cluster.
